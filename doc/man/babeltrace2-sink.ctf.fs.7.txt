NAME
----
babeltrace2-sink.ctf.fs - Babeltrace's file system CTF sink component
class


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Babeltrace compcls:sink.ctf.fs component class, provided by the
man:babeltrace2-plugin-ctf(7) plugin, once instantiated, writes the
events it receives to one or more http://diamon.org/ctf/[CTF] traces on
the file system.

A compcls:sink.ctf.fs component does not merge traces, in that it writes
the notifications of different input traces to different output traces.

This component guarantees that the output traces are semantically
equivalent to the input traces. This means that a given output CTF trace
contains:

* The original trace environment.
* The original clock classes.
* The original event class names, log levels, and other static
  attributes, except for the numeric IDs.
* The original field _values_, except for:
** Timestamp fields, but the equivalent clock value remains the same.
** Numeric ID fields.

The component does not guarantee to keep:

* The original field type attributes (for example, the sizes of the
  integer field types).
* The original stream class and event class numeric IDs.


Output path
~~~~~~~~~~~
The path of a CTF trace is the directory which directly contains the
metadata and data stream files as children.

The rules to determine the path of a generated CTF trace are:

* If the param:single-trace parameter is true, use the value of the
  param:path parameter.
+
Otherwise:
+
--
* If the input trace has a name, use `OUTPUTPATH/TRACENAME[SUFFIX]`,
  where `OUTPUTPATH` is the value of the param:path parameter,
  `TRACENAME` is the input trace's name, and `SUFFIX` is an optional
  numeric suffix if `OUTPUTPATH/TRACENAME` already exists.
+
Note that the name of a trace that a compcls:source.ctf.fs component
creates includes its hostname and its relative path while making sure to
avoid conflicts.
+
Otherwise, use `OUTPUTPATH/trace[SUFFIX]`, where `OUTPUTPATH` and
`SUFFIX` are defined above.

INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS
-------------------------
param:path='PATH' (string, mandatory)::
    Depending on the value of the param:single-trace parameter, prefix
    of output trace paths or full output trace path.

param:single-trace=`yes` (boolean, optional)::
    Assume that the component only receives notifications related to
    a single source trace.


PORTS
-----
Input
~~~~~
`in`::
    Single input port from which the component receives the
    notifications.


QUERY OBJECTS
