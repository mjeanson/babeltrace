NAME
----
babeltrace2-filter.utils.muxer - Babeltrace's notification multiplexer
filter component class


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Babeltrace compcls:filter.utils.muxer component class, provided by
the man:babeltrace2-plugin-utils(7) plugin, once instantiated,
multiplexes the notifications that it receives from one or more input
ports into a linear sequence of events ordered by time on its output
port.

A compcls:filter.utils.muxer component does not alter the notifications
it receives: it only sorts them.

A compcls:filter.utils.muxer component can only work on notifications in
which the clock value with the highest priority has an absolute clock
class. You can use the param:assume-absolute-clock-classes parameter to
make the component assume that all clock classes are absolute. In this
case, you must ensure that, when more than one clock class exists, they
are correlatable.


INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS
-------------------------
The following parameters are optional.

param:assume-absolute-clock-classes=`yes` (boolean)::
    Assume that all clock classes are absolute.


PORTS
-----
Input
~~~~~
`inN`, where `N` is a decimal integer starting at 0::
    Input port from which the component receives notifications to
    multiplex.
+
When you create the component, its only input port is
`in0`. When you connect the `in0` port, the component creates
the `in1` input port, and so on. If you disconnect an input port,
the component does not create a new input port: the disconnected
input port is now available for a new connection.
+
In other words, a compcls:filter.utils.muxer component always makes sure
that it has at least one available input port.


Output
~~~~~~
`out`::
    Single output port to which the component sends the
    sorted notifications.


QUERY OBJECTS
-------------
This component class has no objects to query.
