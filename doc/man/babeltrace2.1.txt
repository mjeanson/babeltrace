NAME
----
babeltrace2 - Convert or process one or more traces, and more


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*babeltrace2* [opt:--debug | opt:--verbose | opt:--log-level='LVL'] ['<<commands,CMD>>'] ['CMD ARGS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
`babeltrace2` is an open-source trace converter and processor. The tool
can convert from one trace format to another, possibly with one or more
filters in the conversion path, and perform other operations depending
on the command 'CMD'.

See man:babeltrace2-intro(7) to learn more about the Babeltrace
project and its core concepts.

Most of the `babeltrace2` commands load Babeltrace plugins to perform
their operation. The search path for Babeltrace plugins is, in this
order:

. The colon-separated list of directories in the
  `BABELTRACE_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable.

. The colon-separated list of directories in the specific command's
  nlopt:--plugin-path option.

. `$HOME/.local/lib/babeltrace2/plugins`

. +{system_plugin_path}+

You can use the man:babeltrace2-list-plugins(1) command to dynamically
list the available plugins and what they offer. See <<plugins,PLUGINS>>
for a list of plugins shipped with Babeltrace.


OPTIONS
-------
opt:-d, opt:--debug::
    Turn the debugging mode on.
+
This is equivalent to opt:--log-level=`VERBOSE`.

opt:-l 'LVL', opt:--log-level='LVL'::
    Set the log level of all known Babeltrace loggers to 'LVL'. You
    can override the level of a specific logger with a dedicated
    log level environment variable. If you don't specify this option,
    it is equivalent to nlopt:--log-level=`WARNING`.
+
The available values for 'LVL' are:
+
--
`NONE`::
`N`::
    Logging is disabled.

`FATAL`::
`F`::
    Severe errors that lead the execution to abort immediately. This
    level should be enabled in production.

`ERROR`::
`E`::
    Errors that might still allow the execution to continue. Usually,
    once one or more errors are reported at this level, the application,
    plugin, or library won't perform any more useful task, but it should
    still exit cleanly. This level should be enabled in production.

`WARN`::
`WARNING`::
`W`::
    Potentially harmful situations which still allow the execution
    to continue. This level should be enabled in production.

`INFO`::
`I`::
    Informational messages that highlight progress or important states
    of the application, plugin, or library. This level can be enabled in
    production.

`DEBUG`::
`D`::
    Debugging information, with a higher level of details than the
    `VERBOSE` level. This level should :not: be enabled in production.

`VERBOSE`::
`V`::
    Low-level debugging context information. This level should :not: be
    enabled in production.
--

opt:-v, opt:--verbose::
    Turn the verbose mode on.
+
This is equivalent to opt:--log-level=`INFO`.

opt:-h, opt:--help::
    Show help and quit.

opt:-V, opt:--version::
    Show version and quit.

COMMANDS

The following commands also have their own nlopt:--help option.
