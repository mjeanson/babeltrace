NAME
----
babeltrace2-sink.utils.counter - Babeltrace's notification counter sink
component class


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Babeltrace compcls:sink.utils.counter component class, provided by
the man:babeltrace2-plugin-utils(7) plugin, once instantiated, prints to
the standard output the number of notifications it receives on its input
port, with a count for each type.

The component's output looks like this:

----
         664891 events
             12 stream beginnings
              0 stream ends
             93 packet beginnings
             81 packet ends
              0 inactivities
              6 discarded events notifications
         375378   known discarded events
              2 discarded packets notifications
              5   known discarded packets
        1040455 notifications (TOTAL)
----

By default, a compcls:sink.utils.counter component prints a new block of
statistics every 1000 received notifications, whatever their types. You
can use the param:step parameter to override this default period.

The component always prints a block of statistics when there's no more
notifications to receive from its input port and the last block was
different.

By default, a compcls:sink.utils.counter component prints the count of
notifications for each type, even if this count is 0. You can make it
hide the zero counts with the param:hide-zero parameter.


INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS
-------------------------
The following parameters are optional.

param:hide-zero=`yes` (boolean)::
    Do not print the statistics lines where the count is zero.

param:step='STEP' (integer)::
    Print a new block of statistics every 'STEP' received notifications
    instead of 1000. If 'STEP' is 0, then the component only prints
    statistics when there's no more notifications to receive.


PORTS
-----
Input
~~~~~
`in`::

    notifications to count.
