@section includefiles Include files

You can find all the Babeltrace library include files (C headers) in the
\c babeltrace2 directory under the include files directory chosen when
installing Babeltrace. By default, this is <code>/usr/include</code>.
If you build Babeltrace from source without specifying an installation
prefix, this is <code>/usr/local/include</code>.

The documentation modules in \ref apiref always show which header file
to include to use the documented functions and types.

You can also use the "master" include file which provides everything,
but which necessarily makes the compilation slower:

@code
#include <babeltrace2/babeltrace.h>
@endcode

@section howtobuild How to build

Multiple types of applications can use the Babeltrace library:

- A user plugin (shared object) to be loaded by the \c babeltrace2
  converter program or by another application.
- A user application or library which loads plugins to manually connect
  existing components in a specific way.
- A user application or library which creates its own component classes
  and manually connects them.

In any way, the only library to link to is `libbabeltrace2`.

@subsection howtobuildplugin Build a plugin

To build a user plugin:

<ol>
    <li>Compile the source files which form your plugin:

@verbatim
cc -c -fpic my-plugin.c
@endverbatim
    </li>

    <li>Create the plugin shared object:

@verbatim
cc -shared my-plugin.o -lbabeltrace2 -o my-plugin.so
@endverbatim
    </li>
</ol>

@subsection howtobuildapp Build an application

To build an application which uses the Babeltrace library:

<ol>
    <li>Compile the source files which form your application:

@verbatim
cc -c my-app.c
@endverbatim
    </li>

    <li>Create the executable application:

@verbatim
cc my-app.o -lbabeltrace2 -o my-app
@endverbatim
    </li>
</ol>
